## **Project Title: Smart Budget Tracker**

### **Project Overview**

Smart Budget Planner is a personal finance management application designed to help users take control of their monthly income, track their expenses, categorize spending, and build a consistent savings habit. The system focuses on distinguishing between **needs** and **wants**, setting clear **deadlines for bill payments**, identifying **overspending trends**, and encouraging users to save with **goal-oriented planning**.
